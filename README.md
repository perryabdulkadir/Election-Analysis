# Election Analysis
Columbia Data Science Module 3

## Project Overview
In this project, Tom of the Colorado Board of Elections has tasked me with auditing the election results for Colorado's 1st Congressional District. Using Python, I have been tasked with coming up with the following figures for the race: 
1) the total number of votes cast
2) votes broken down by county in absolute terms and as percentages
3) the county with the largest number of votes cast
4) a breakdown of the number and percentage of votes cast by candidate
5) the winner of the popular vote, along with the number of votes they received and their share of the vote total
